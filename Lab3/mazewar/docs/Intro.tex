\section{Introduction}\label{Intro}

This document aims to describe the general design and algorithm used in developing a decentralized version of Mazewar game implemented in Lab 2 of ECE419 Distributed System course. In addition, possible inconsistency of game state will be described and corresponding solution will be addressed. Furthermore, additional design that enables dynamic player leave and join as well as Robot client will be discussed.
